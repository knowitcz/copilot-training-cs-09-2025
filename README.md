# AI for Developers training

## Introduction
The training aims to familiarize users with AI tools for software development. 
The primary tool is GitHub Copilot, complemented by ChatGPT. The training is 
designed to be mostly practical, with participants working in pairs to solve 
individual tasks. Initially, tasks are tackled without AI tools and then 
repeated with their assistance. In addition to the principles of working
with AI, another main focus of the training is on creating testable software 
and adhering to best practices for writing high-quality software (such as the 
SOLID principles, etc.). 

The training content is planned for 8 hours but may
be shorter depending on the expertise of the participants.

## Tech stack
The training is conducted in the Java programming language using the Spring 
Boot and Hibernate ORM frameworks. The application uses an Oracle database 
for data persistence, and access to the application is provided 
through a public API (both application and REST). The public API documentation 
is created using the Swagger library.

## Prerequisites
Participants of the training should have the following set up:
 - A development environment that supports working with GitHub Copilot 
        (preferably IntelliJ IDEA)
 - An established GitHub account (either a personal or a temporary one for 
      the purpose of the training)
 - The GitHub Copilot plugin for the development environment, including an 
      active license (an individual trial version is sufficient)
